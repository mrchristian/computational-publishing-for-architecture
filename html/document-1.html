      <p>The project is being conducted in the context of NFDI4Culture — a research infrastructure consortium, and; with COPIM an international research partnership working on open infrastructures for monographs. </p>
      <p>The central question for the project is how can an existing publishers infrastructures and workflows incorporate computational publishing — the combinations of text and executable code — as applicable to the topic area of architecture. In addition we will be looking at how 'enhanced publishing principles' for open access and FAIR-publishing can support the use of computational publishing. </p>

          <p><strong>Enhanced Publications:</strong> How to make a <strong>publication open</strong> in the context of modern computational and networked systems, and what <strong>additional functionality</strong> and <strong>enrichment</strong> can be added. What types of <strong>requirements </strong>are made of scholarly publishing to be fully open, and <strong>how these are implemented </strong>in systems or infrastructures.

          <p><strong>Computational publishing (Literate programming): <span class="citation">(Knuth, 1992)</span></strong> Computational publishing means to combine both text and computational functionality on a single hypertext document. A modern instantiation is Jupyter Notebooks — with the <em>replication crisis</em> in science literature accounting for its popularity — as code, data, and findings can be presented in one instance for speedy verification. Computational publishing has its roots in the 1945 idea of the <em>Memex</em> by Vannevar Bush,&nbsp;and then later in 1972 articulated as the <em>Dynabook</em> outlined by Alan Kay. <span class="citation">(Odewahn, 2021)</span> For the project the following computational publishing platforms will be used: Jupyter Notebooks, Juypter Books, and Curvenote.</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>'<a href="http://www.literateprogramming.com/">Literate programming</a>&nbsp;is a methodology that combines a programming language with a documentation language, thereby making programs more robust, more portable, more easily maintained, and arguably more fun to write than programs that are written only in a high-level language. The main idea is to treat a program as a piece of literature, addressed to human beings rather than to a computer. The program is also viewed as a hypertext document, rather like the World Wide Web. (Indeed, I used the word WEB for this purpose long before CERN grabbed it!)' - Donald E. Knuth, 1992<a href="#fn2" class="fn"><span class="footnote-counter" data-chapter-counter="2" data-book-counter="2"></span></a>&nbsp;</p>

          <p><strong>Architecture:</strong> The context for architecture in this project is in two areas, firstly, in terms of the history of architecture and its open publishing representation; secondly, in contemporary practice of either using open-source tools, studio practice, or in simulations and planning related to questions, such as 'open energy modelling'.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Publication infrastructures:</strong> For open publishing using computational publishing and enhanced publishing principles the questions are about integration and compatibility with existing infrastructures. The publishing infrastructures being covered will be conventional monographs and research papers. The enhanced publication features would be, for example: real-time collaborative editing platforms, linked open data, 3D models, and semantic video, etc. The infrastructures being used in the project will be that of: </p>

      <h2 id="H2831995">Motivation</h2>
      <p>Computational publishing's greatest achievement has been to inspire with the utopian vision of a better world through the use of knowledge and learning, and its model of digital publishing. Work at PARC (Palo Alto Research Center) and on Kay's Dynabook was taken and made into the products of the personal computer and later the tablet computer. </p>
      <p>But at the same time, in its more than seventy-five years history, computational publishing itself, as a paradigm, has failed to be realised in full. </p>
      <p>The recent prominence of Jupyter Notebooks has shown a promising route for new life in computational publishing. As at last there is a substantial and flexible publishing framework that a large number of stakeholders have bought into.</p>
      <p>In the area of architecture allows exciting opportunities for computational publishing and these are already being explored. These area are for example: data visualisations and simulations, for the manipulation of design tools for robotics such as component fabrication, and in the presentation and exchange of ideas in 3D multi-modal-media and on social media platform.</p>
      <p>Enhanced Publishing principles and testing implementation plans can play an important role in contributing to sustainability and to real-world working models of computational publishing to support its use on monographs and research publications.</p>
